abstract = "Research has shown that emoji can determine how interlocutors who use emoji are perceived (e.g., warmer) and can help complement written communication (e.g., clarify the meaning of a message). We argue that reciprocal emoji use may be particularly beneficial for user perceptions and communication outcomes. In two experiments (N = 568), we examined if using emoji, and reciprocating emoji use, in a work context (i.e., message between colleagues) influenced inferences about interlocutors and communication outcomes (Study 1), and if such effects differed according to the level of conflict between interlocutors (Study 2). Study 1 showed that using💪  (vs.✍️ ) resulted in higher perceptions of warmth, playfulness, and message’s positivity, whereas no benefits of using 👎 (vs.✍️ ) were observed. Likewise, reciprocating emoji use (🤷 vs. no emoji) resulted in higher perceptions of warmth, playfulness, and communication positivity. Study 2 showed only an effect of conflict in the scenario, such that, regardless of reciprocal emoji use, in the lower (vs. higher) conflict situation, perceptions of the interlocutor (e.g., warmer, more competent, more playful), and the conversation (e.g., messages more positive, less confrontational) were more favorable. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of emoji valence for person perception and communication outcomes, while also suggesting some emoji may not impact communication under specific circumstances (e.g., during situations of conflict)."

abstract = "People vary in the effectiveness with which they can change the way that others feel, yet we know surprisingly little about what drives these individuals differences in interpersonal emotion regulation success. This paper provides a framework for describing success in interpersonal emotion regulation and synthesizes extant theory and research regarding how personality and cognitive ability relate to interpersonal emotion regulation success. In doing so, our review brings together work from several related fields to offer an integrative framework to generate and guide future research that aims to understand why some people are proficient at influencing the emotions of others and why some are not, often suffering additional unintended consequences, such as diminished work or relationship success."
